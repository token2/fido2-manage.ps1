# FIDO2 Token Management Tool
> [!NOTE]  
> Due to frequent antivirus false positives on PowerShell executables, weâ€™re replacing wrappers and GUI apps with a new C++-based project. It will remain open source but will be harder to compile than the one-click PowerShell version. Thank you for your understanding as we improve reliability!
