# FIDO2 Token Management Tool


##Announcement: PS1 Project Update

Due to frequent antivirus false positives on PowerShell executables, weâ€™re replacing wrappers and GUI apps with a new C++-based project. It will remain open source but will be harder to compile than the one-click PowerShell version. Thank you for your understanding as we improve reliability!

## Overview

The FIDO2 Token Management Tool (`fido2-manage.ps1`) is a PowerShell script designed to enhance the usability of the libfido2 toolset. This tool provides a convenient way to perform various operations related to FIDO2 tokens, making it easier for users to manage their FIDO2 authentication devices.

## Key Features

- **User-Friendly Interface**: The tool uses a modified version libfido2 executable to allow for more intuitive interaction, including human-readable device names.
- **PIN Entry as an Argument**: Simplifies the process by allowing PIN entry directly as a command-line argument.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Windows operating system
- PowerShell
- FIDO2 authentication device


### Installation / Compilation

1. Download the script and extract to a folder (on some systems the encoding is wrongly set when downloading, make sure the ps1 files are in UTF-8+BOM encoding)
2. Open Powershell session as admin and change to that folder
3. Execute 
```powershell
Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope Process Bypass
```
and confirm the action (`Yes` or `Yes to All`)

4. Run `.\prepare.ps1`
5. The exe files are ready to launch

### One Step Compilation
Alternatively, you can simply run the `compile.bat` batch file to get all exe files generated

### Usage

You can use the FIDO2 Token Management Tool by either running the `fido2-manage.ps1` script directly with PowerShell or compiling it to an executable using ps2exe.

You can compile the script to an executable using ps2exe for easier distribution:

`ps2exe .\fido2-manage.ps1 .\fido2-manage.exe`

#### Running with PowerShell

To run the tool with PowerShell, open a PowerShell prompt and execute the script with the desired options. For example:

```powershell
.\fido2-manage.ps1 -list
```



# Libfido2 Executable

This executable is included as a compiled `.exe` file and signed with the Token2 Code Signing certificate. However, the source code of the tool is available in the main project at [https://github.com/token2/fido2-manage](https://github.com/token2/fido2-manage).
